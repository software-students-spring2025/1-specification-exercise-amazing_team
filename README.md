## Stakeholders

### Goals/Needs:

- Know when rooms are available/occupied in advance
- Be able to reserve rooms in advance
- Know what spaces are for quiet study or open discussion
- Be able to charge devices when studying
- Find a space with features that match your purpose
- Boost flexibility for students when organizing group meetings and even club events


### Frustrations/Problems:

- It is hard to find quiet spaces on campus
- It takes time to find available spaces at Bobst during midterms/finals
- People who live far from campus need a place to be or socialize in between their classes
- It is difficult to coordinate back-to-back events, discouraging creation of new ones
- It is hard to find spots for clubs to host meetings/events



### Have you ever avoided reserving a room on campus because it was inconvenient?

**Sam:** “My freshman year I didn’t even know you could reserve rooms. But even after I found out, I still didn’t really bother.”

**Andy:** “After going to a bunch of different spots on campus I kind of figured out which ones are the least crowded and go there because I don’t want to deal with reserving or checking anything. But it would be nice to be able to go to the other spots.”

---

### Have you ever been in a position where you need a private space for studying?

**Sam:** “I have a roommate so pretty much all the time.”

**Andy:** “Yeah. I have a lot of projects that require working with other people and it’s hard to do that in many places because you need to talk.”

---

### Have you ever been to Bobst and there were no rooms available?

**Sam:** “During midterms and finals, it’s impossible to find anywhere to work.”

**Andy:** “So many times.”

---

### Have you ever wanted to know how crowded your study spot is?

**Sam:** “Yeah. It would be really nice to know how crowded the places are before going all the way there.”

**Andy:** “I usually just assume it's full.”


## Product Vision Statement
